Hi Victoria,

You are probably getting sick of hearing from me (I believe I sent you an email yesterday regarding another job), but I came across this position today, and again, I think I could be a great fit and would love to hear more about the opportunity.

A little about myself, I have roughly 10 years of software engineering experience, including 5 at Google.  A short list of tools and technology I have some professional experience with are Javascript (frontend/backend), HTML/CSS, C/C++, Python, Java (Android), Linux, BASH, Nginx, Apache, Docker, Jenkins, JIRA and many others that I at least experimented with.

What sounds really interesting to me about this position is, it sounds as though they want a seasoned engineer with a generalist background (not necessarily a specialist) and most importantly, a good problem solver.  In addition, I have roughly 4 years working remotely.  I'm not sure if this is a remote position, or just entails working with a remote team, but I am open to both.

If you think I could be a good match for the position or any others you are aware of, I would love to schedule a phone call and discuss it further.
