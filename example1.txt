My diverse technical background, frontend development experience and previous agency exposure would make me an excellent candidate for a  role at Creative Circle.

Over the past ten years, I have been employed as an engineer and for the past 5 or more years, focused in a frontend and interaction development.

Please take a look at my resume, with an array of links and examples of past work.  If you think there could be a fit, I would love to hear more about the opportunity.

Thanks for your time and consideration.

Bradley
