Dear Axiom,

My diverse technical background, interest in open source and prior experience with digital mapping while working on Google Earth and Google Maps could make me an excellent candidate for your advertised position.

During the last 10 years, including 5 at Google, I have been exposed to a wide range of challenging positions, including data pipelines, writing backend servers, real-time data collection and frontend development.  I have used a number of languages, but more important than the languages themselves, I understand language paradigms (object-oriented/functional/imperative/logic/etc) and concepts like statically-typed vs dynamically-typed, closures, generators, etc.

I don't have every skill you are asking for, but I have a track record of quickly getting up to speed with new technologies and it sounds like you have some really exciting problems to work on.

Find below a link to my resume, as well as links to my Github, StackOverflow, and other potentially relevant links.  My Github profile is a bit messy with over 200 repos, but something I have been working on recently is a Python CLI tool to generate animated L-Systems using SVG animation features.

Looking over the whole of my repos could give you a sense of the variety of interests in computer science I have.  If any of this makes me a potential candidate, I would love to hear more about the position and your engineering culture.

Thanks for your time and consideration.

Bradley
