Dear Apsalar,

My diverse technical background, attention to detail and great communication skills would make me an excellent addition to your team as a Full Stack Engineer.

For the past ten years, including five at Google, I have been exposed to a wide range of technologies, including Javascript/Angular/React, Python/Django, and tooling like Jenkins and Docker for continuous testing, integration and deployment.

More recently, I had exposure to developing the soft skills involved with leading a software team, including gathering requirements, validating a design, implementation and testing in an Agile environment with SCRUMM style standups and JIRA management.  Also of particular interest to this position, I have had experience working remotely for over 4 years now.  I am a self-starter, know how to solve problems, when to ask for help and manage my time.

Find attached a copy of my resume in PDF format, and if you feel like I am a good fit, I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

Bradley
